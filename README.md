#### Aim of the Project <a name="aim-of-the-project"></a>
This study seeks to investigate the effect of feature selection approaches on the effectiveness of machine learning models for forecasting employee attrition. The study uses L1 regularization and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to find the most relevant elements affecting turnover and improve model accuracy.

#### Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
Project Overview: The project compares the performance of Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models with and without feature selection. Using the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset, it compares alternative feature selection strategies, including the union of L1 and RFE, and examines their effect on model efficiency, predictive accuracy, and feature importance in forecasting employee turnover.

#### Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
This research data was sourced from Kaggle IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition (Subhash, 2021)
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset"

The data collection contains 1,470 records of employee information, with 35 parameters such as age, work satisfaction, performance rating, monthly pay, years with the company, and attrition (staff turnover). The data collection includes both qualitative and numerical characteristics, such as employee details, experience, and remuneration, which can be utilized to build predictive models. Surprisingly, the last column, called "Attrition", is the answer variable that indicates whether or not the employee left.
